## Introduction 

This project is a component of the Algorithm and Data Structure 2 course offered at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte. The main goal of this endeavor is to create a directed network (graph) using links from Wikipedia pages and conduct a comprehensive analysis using network concepts. The process of generating the network begins with a specific Wikipedia page and is limited to a depth level of 2. The selection of GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems  was made as the basis for generating the network.
